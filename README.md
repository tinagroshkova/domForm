# domForm
Stylized form by given layout using only DOM API (task from the IT Talents training camp):

Task 1: Build the following HTML page with a form and style it, using only the DOM API! 
1. Page background: linear-gradient(45deg, #FA8BFF 0%, #2BD2FF 52%, #2BFF88 90%);
2. Submit button background - linear-gradient(90deg, #FA8BFF 0%, #2BD2FF 52%, #2BFF88
90%);
3. Form padding – 40px – on top, right, left, on the bottom side -> 100px.
4. Font: Roboto
5. Select box – background: whitesmoke
6. Inputs and buttons height -> 40px
7. From width -> 40%
Hint: You can first build the form with HTML and CSS only and then try to achieve the same look via 
JS.
Everything else that is not specified in this requirements is your decision as long as the looks are the 
same as the picture below: ![Screenshot_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57560115/223220261-2bad6672-de94-493d-bd6e-6499de791b76.png)
